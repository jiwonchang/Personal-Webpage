					Hi there! I'm an aspiring software engineer who is currently studying the in's-and-out's of web development. I've always had a bit of an artistic inclination ever since I was a wee lad, and always wanted to nurture and grow that aspect of myself. Well, my love of art and coding has apparently had some fun and produced a love child in the form of the perfect opportunity known to the world as web development.

					Hi there! I'm a UC Berkeley grad aspiring to become a software engineer. I majored in Statistics while in UCSB and then in Applied Mathematics when I transferred to UC Berkeley, but the few Computer Science courses I took as prerequisites peaked my interest in the world of programming. Such interests led me to delve even further and to take the core CS classes such as those in Data Structures and Algorithms. I've had the pleasure of working on numerous amazing course projects such as the Enigma Machine Project, in which I reproduced the Enigma machine that served a key role in WWII (except my enigma machine was fully virtual, with the moving pieces of the actual enigma machine implemented in their full functionality as objects).

					I'm also eager to learn new skills and technologies that help individuals and companies create wonderful content and products. That's why I'm currently studying the in's-and-out's of web development. I've always had a bit of an artistic inclination ever since I was a wee lad, and always wanted to nurture and grow that aspect of myself. It would seem that I've found the perfect blend between my love of art and coding in the form of web development!
